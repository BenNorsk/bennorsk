### Hey everyone!
This is my Github profile, where I host various personal projects. 
## Fiorella Code
It is certainly worth checking out Fiorella Code, my own esoteric programming language, created for my girlfirend Fiorella. Saying it is a brainfuck sister is sort of an understatement, it is pretty much brainfuck.
## Crypto Society St. Gallen
Also, while the code is not published, you may be interested in the [website of the Crypto Society St. Gallen](https://cryptosocietystgallen.club/), which I've created 
as a python flask application.
