### Hey everyone!
This is my Github profile, where I host various personal projects. It is certainly worth checking out Fiorella Code, my own esoteric programming language (yes, created for my girlfirend Fiorella).
Also, while the code is not published, you may be interested in the [website of the Crypto Society St. Gallen](https://cryptosocietystgallen.club/), which I've created 
as a python flask application.
